# Medical-LLM Benchmarking Suite (MLBS) 🩺

**The Industry Standard for Clinical Safety Evaluation.**

Based on the peer-reviewed research:  
> *Banerjee, S. (2025). Transforming Healthcare with State-of-The-Art Medical-LLMs: A Comprehensive Evaluation.* [cite: 173]

## 🔬 Overview
General benchmarks fail to capture **clinical safety**. MLBS provides a specialized testing harness to identify **medical hallucinations** in dosage and diagnosis.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Hallucination Scorer:** Detects "confabulations" in clinical reasoning.
- **Privacy-First Benchmarking:** Optimized for local SLM (Small Language Model) deployments.
- **NIST AI RMF Alignment:** Designed for healthcare AI safety compliance.
